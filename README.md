# Card sourcing
The card packs attached to this game are sourced from the [JSON Against Humanity](https://github.com/crhallberg/json-against-humanity) repository. Some of these cards are created by the official Cards Against Humanity team, while other cards have been created by other people.

This repository has a default card set attached to it already, but if you wish to switch it out for your own cards, or even add to it, simply modify the [pack.json](pack.json) file. Just make sure to keep following the same structure and format.
